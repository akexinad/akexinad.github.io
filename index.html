      <a class="main-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/engineeringporn" target="_blank">I love all things engineering. Virtual and physical.</a>
      <br><br>

      And I love building things. Virtual and Physical. My genuine curiosity renders me unafraid to make mistakes, deconstruct, analyse, abstract, and build again. It is these aspects that helped me thrive during my time as an aspiring academic, a project manager in construction and engineering, and for fun, a mechanical watchmaker and arduinist.
      <br><br>

      I believe it is the passion for abstraction coupled with sheer will that gave me the strength to make such leaps in the past and many more in the future as an engineer. It is this passion that reminds me that I find comfort in the uncomfortable struggle of grappling with new tech and new ideas. This is where I thrive. This is where I am happy.
